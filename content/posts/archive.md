With the old event page at https://tcevents.chem.uzh.ch gone, we recovered a [static copy of the events](https://archive.fortrancon.org).
While the download of supplemental material (slides for example) works, the links to the recording on Youtube may be broken.

They are still available on [our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@fortrancon), direct links to the playlists:
