We are finally preparing a new edition of FortranCon.
While the call for submissions and registration is not yet open, you can already find some details on the [conference website](https://events.fortrancon.org/event/1/).

At the same time, we are preparing the new website (which you are reading right now) and some changes to our governance. Stay tuned...
